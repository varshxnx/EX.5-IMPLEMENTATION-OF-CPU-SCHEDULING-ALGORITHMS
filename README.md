# FIRST-COME-FIRST-SERVE (FCFS) SCHEDULING:
## AIM:
To implement First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) Scheduling

## ALGORITHM:
1.Start with a queue (or a list) to represent the ready queue of processes.

2.Initialize a timer or clock to 0.

3.Read the number of processes (n) and create a data structure to store process information, including arrival time (AT) and burst time (BT) for each process.

4.Read the arrival time and burst time for each process and store them in the data structure.

5.Sort the processes in the ready queue based on their arrival times in ascending order. This step ensures that processes are executed in the order they arrive.

6.Initialize the waiting time (WT) and turnaround time (TAT) for the first process to 0.

7.For each process in the ready queue (in the order of arrival): a. Calculate the start time (ST) as the maximum of the current time and the arrival time of the process. b. Calculate the finish time (FT) as the start time plus the burst time of the process. c. Calculate the waiting time (WT) for the process as the start time minus the arrival time. d. Calculate the turnaround time (TAT) for the process as the finish time minus the arrival time. e. Update the current time to the finish time.

8.Calculate the average waiting time (AWT) and average turnaround time (ATAT) for all processes by summing up the individual waiting times and turnaround times and dividing by the total number of processes.

9.Display the waiting time, turnaround time, and other relevant information for each process.

10.Display the average waiting time and average turnaround time for all processes.

11.End.

# SHORTEST JOB SCHEDULING (SJF) PRE-EMPTIVE SCHEDULING:
## AIM:
To implement Shortest Job First (SJF) Pre-emptive Scheduling.

## ALGORITHM:
1.Initialize variables and arrays to store process information, such as process ID (p), arrival time (at), burst time (bt), start time (st), finish time (ft), waiting time (wt), turnaround time (tt), response ratio (rr), and a flag to mark completed processes (iscompleted).

3.Read the process ID, arrival time, and burst time for each process and store them in respective arrays (p, at, bt).

4.Initialize variables, such as nextst (next start time) and counters.

Update the start time, finish time, waiting time, and turnaround time for the selected process. c. Calculate the response ratio (rr) for the selected process (rr = turnaround time / burst time). d. Mark the selected process as completed. e. Update the nextst to the finish time of the selected process.

# SHORTEST JOB SCHEDULING (SJF) NON PRE-EMPTIVE SCHEDULING:

## AIM:
To implement Shortest Job First (SJF) Non-Preemptive Scheduling

## ALGORITHM:
1.Initialize variables and arrays to store process information, such as process ID (process_id), arrival time (arrival_time), burst time (burst_time), completion time (completion_time), waiting time (waiting_time), and turnaround time (turnaround_time).

2.Read the number of processes (n) from the user.

3.Input process information for each process, including arrival time and burst time, and store this information in the respective arrays.

4.Sort the processes based on their arrival times in ascending order using a simple bubble sort algorithm. This step ensures that processes are in the order of their arrival.

5.Initialize the current time (time) to 0.

6.Perform the scheduling loop for all processes: a. Find the process with the smallest burst time that has already arrived and is not yet completed. Initialize "shortest_job" to -1 and "shortest_time" to a large initial value. b. Iterate through the processes, checking if they have arrived and if their burst time is smaller than the current "shortest_time." If so, update "shortest_job" to the current process. c. If "shortest_job" remains -1, it means no process is available to run at this time. Increment the time by 1.

d. If a process is available (shortest_job != -1), execute the selected process. Update the completion time, waiting time, and turnaround time for this process. Mark the burst time of the completed process as -1 to indicate completion.

7.Display the scheduling information in a tabular format, including Process ID (P), Arrival Time (AT), Burst Time (BT), Completion Time (CT), Waiting Time (WT), and Turnaround Time (TAT) for each process.

# ROUND ROBIN (RR) SCHEDULING:

## AIM: 
To implement Round Robin (RR) Scheduling.

ALGORITHM:
1.Initialize variables and arrays to store process information, scheduling data, and status flags.

2.Read the number of processes (n) and the time quantum (tq) from the user.

3.Input process information for each process, including process ID (PRO), arrival time (AT), and burst time (BUT). Also, calculate the total remaining burst time (totalsrt) and create a temporary array (tempsrt) to store the initial burst times.

4.Initialize the queue (queue), front (f), rear (r), and count variables for the ready queue. Also, initialize the timer to 0.

5.Enqueue processes that arrive at time 0 into the ready queue and mark them as entered (isentered) with count increments.

6.Enter the main scheduling loop, which continues until the timer reaches the total remaining burst time (totalsrt).

7.Dequeue a process from the front of the ready queue (queue[f]) and select it for execution.

8.If the selected process is starting for the first time (isstarted is 0), record its start time (ST) and calculate its waiting time (WT).

9.Execute the process for a time quantum (tq) or until its burst time (BUT) is less than tq, whichever comes first. Update the timer accordingly.

10.If the process has completed its burst time (BUT becomes 0), record its finish time (FT), calculate its waiting time (WT), turnaround time (TT), and response ratio (RR), and mark it as completed (iscompleted).

11.Check for processes that have arrived and have not entered the ready queue (isentered is 0). Enqueue them into the ready queue with count increments.

12.If the selected process is not completed, enqueue it back into the ready queue.

13.Repeat the scheduling loop until the timer reaches totalsrt.

14.Display the scheduling results, including process ID (PRO), arrival time (AT), initial burst time (BUT), start time (ST), finish time (FT), waiting time (WT), turnaround time (TT), and response ratio (RR) for each process.

15.Calculate and display the average waiting time (AWT) and average turnaround time (ATAT) for all processes.

## OUTPUT:
![5f](https://github.com/varshxnx/EX.5-IMPLEMENTATION-OF-CPU-SCHEDULING-ALGORITHMS/assets/122253525/f0c8e972-89c6-432a-b97d-07d21b01a553)



## RESULT: 
Priority Non pre-emptive scheduling is implemented successfully.
